#### Introduction:

This application aims to help UT newcomers, as well as existing Longhorns, faculty members and staff, know UT better from the aspect of UT landmarks and buildings, and the associated stories. For example, a user could open his/her APP while walking around UT tower, click the mark associated with UT tower (or create one if it does not exist), then he/she shall be able to see a brief (might be a longer wiki) introduction of UT tower and many photos that other people shared related to UT tower. In addition to posting photos, users shall also be able to write reviews/comments about UT tower and edit the introduction as they deem appropriate (might change this function).
